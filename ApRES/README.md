# ApRES-related items
A folder to keep track of project-specific ApRES items. This is for things like deployment instructions, specific software configurations, and any other specifics where updates can be tracked with Git.


Project specific processing scripts will probably end here as well.


For existing ApRES processing and documentation, this separate repository can come in handy: https://github.com/ldeo-glaciology/phase-sensitive-radar-processing
